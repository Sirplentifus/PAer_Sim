function [ T ] = EngineThrust( V, Pars )
%EngineThrust - Computes the engine thrust as a function of velocity and
%other parameters
%   Input:
%   V - Aircraft speed. Unused for now
%   Pars - Relevant parametres. None used for now.
%   Output:
%   T - Total Engine thrust (for all engines combined)

T = 80e3;
